                    online programs at SNHU, and each student has their own set
                    of
                    goals and reasons for attending. But here are three
                    important
                    ones to keep in mind.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>1. Learn more, earn more</strong><br>
                      The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the
                      usual
                      median weekly earnings of a worker with a bachelor's
                      degree is
                      $1,305 and $781 for those with a high school diploma.
                      That's a
                      67% increase.<sup>1</sup></li><br>
                    <li><strong>2. Lower your risk of unemployment</strong><br>
                      Earning your college degree could also lead to more career
                      stability. According to 2020 data from the U.S. Bureau of
                      Labor Statistics, just 5.5% of workers with a bachelor's
                      degree were unemployed, compared to 9% of workers with
                      only a
                      high school diploma.<sup>1</sup></li><br>
                    <li><strong>3. Be happier in your career</strong><br>
                      The Pew Research Center found that 60% of workers with a
                      bachelor's degree feel their job gives them a sense of
                      identity, versus just 38% of those with a high school
                      diploma
                      or less.<sup>2</sup> Workers with at least a bachelor's
                      degree
                      were also almost twice as likely as those with no college
                      education to say their job is a career.<sup>2</sup></li><br>

                    According to the National Center for Education Statistics,
                    students who pursue their bachelor's degree at private
                    nonprofit
                    institutions experience much higher graduation rates than
                    their
                    counterparts at for-profit schools.

                    SNHU is a private, fully accredited institution. As a
                    private
                    university, we rely heavily on private donations,
                    contributions
                    and tuition to provide nationally recognized education for
                    our
                    students.

                    SNHU offers countless resources to ensure student success,
                    including, but not limited to, merit-based scholarship
                    programs,
                    dedicated advisor support and lifetime access to career
                    services

                  <p>First off, it’s a great idea to think of this as a two-part

                    <strong>1. Reduce tuition costs</strong><br></p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Choose an affordable university like SNHU</strong><br>
                    As a nonprofit university, SNHU has some of the lowest
                    online
                    tuition in the nation.

                    When comparing costs of universities, we recommend looking
                    at
                    the “cost per credit.” To get a sense of your overall cost,
                    simply multiply the cost per credit by the number of credits
                    you
                    need for your degree. Most bachelor’s degrees are 120
                    credits.
                    For example, SNHU’s online tuition cost is $330/credit —
                    which
                    is among the lowest tuition rates in the nation.

                  <p><strong>Ask about employer tuition assistance</strong></p>
                  <p>Many employers will assist with the cost of your degree in
                    the
                    form of tuition assistance, tuition discounts or tuition
                    reimbursement. Some might fund it completely depending on
                    how
                    your tuition benefits work! Ask your employer if this
                    benefit is
                    available to you.</p>
                  <p>SNHU also has partnerships with hundreds of employers
                    across
                    the country. Call or text an admission counselor at
                    888.387.0861
                    to find out if your employer is an SNHU partner.</p>

                  <p><strong>2. Make college payments affordable.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Consider student loans</strong></p>
                  <p>After you've taken all the steps you can to reduce the cost
                    of
                    your tuition, it still may not be possible for you to pay
                    out of
                    pocket for your remaining costs. If that’s the case, student
                    loans can help you fund your education.</p>
                  <p>If you’re thinking about taking out one or more federal or
                    private student loans, talk to our financial services team
                    about
                    smart borrowing practices and get all the information you
                    need
                    to fund your educational future. Keep in mind that you don't
                    need to take out loans for the full amount you're approved
                    for.
                    It's important to borrow responsibly because you'll be
                    responsible for paying back any student loans you take.</p>

                  <p><strong>Take fewer classes per term</strong></p>
                  <p>Many SNHU students make college more affordable and
                    achievable
                    by taking only one class per term. This allows students to
                    pay
                    for tuition using savings rather than taking out loans while
                    also setting a manageable pace for studying while working
                    full
                    time. Yes, it takes longer to graduate, but thousands of our
                    SNHU students have earned their degrees this way!</p>
                  <p>Note: Attending SNHU part time may affect your eligibility

                    credit
                    eligibility, cost and time considerations are all factors
                    that
                    may affect how many years it takes to earn a degree. Here’s
                    the
                    breakdown:</p>
                  <p><strong>Associate degree — usually 2 years</strong></p>
                  <p>An associate degree usually requires 60 credits and is
                    often
                    referred to as a 2-year degree. But there are ways to finish
                    an
                    associate degree faster! At SNHU, you can transfer up to 45
                    previously earned college credits toward an associate
                    degree,
                    helping you get that credential even quicker.</p>
                  <p>Associate degrees can often be applied when going on to
                    earn
                    your bachelor’s degree. Depending on which associate degree
                    you
                    earn, you could be halfway to your bachelor’s degree!</p>
                  <p><strong>Bachelor’s degree — usually 4 years</strong></p>
                  <p>Many factors will affect how long it takes to earn your
                    degree,
                    but 4 years is the traditional timetable to earn the 120
                    credits
                    you need. At SNHU, students pursuing their bachelor's degree
                    online typically take 1-2 courses per term. With six 8-week
                    terms throughout the year, you can complete as many as 12
                    courses annually.</p>
                  <p>If you’ve earned college credits at other universities, you
                    may
                    be eligible to transfer up to 90 credits toward your
                    bachelor’s
                    degree at SNHU, saving you time and money. Many of our
                    students
                    enroll at SNHU with transfer credits.</p>

                  <p><strong>Master’s degrees — usually 1-2 years</strong></p>
                  <p>How long it takes to get a master’s degree depends on you
                    and
                    the program you choose. Typically, it takes 1-2 years to
                    complete. In some cases, you can finish in less time, and in
                    others, you may want more time to progress through your
                    courses
                    or may need longer to meet specific program requirements.
                    Your
                    degree, college, desired pacing and personal goals are all
                    factors to consider.</p>
                  <p>One of the biggest variables when it comes to the length of
                    a
                    master’s degree is the number of credits. While bachelor’s
                    degrees are typically 120 credits, making them 4-year
                    degrees,
                    master’s programs can vary greatly, ranging from 30-60
                    credits.
                    For example, our MBA is 30 credits while our MFA in Creative
                    Writing is 48 credits. </p>
